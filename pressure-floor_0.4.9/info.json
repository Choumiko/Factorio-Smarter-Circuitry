  "description": "Adds a new type of flooring that when combined with a directional sensor is capable of detecting mobile objects. Once the sensor is placed targeting a pressure floor tile, a square region extending in the direction of the sensor will be used as the detecting area. The size of this area depends on how many pressure floor tiles are present.",
